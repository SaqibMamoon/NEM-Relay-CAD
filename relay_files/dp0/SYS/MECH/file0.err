 A reference force value times the tolerance is used by the              
 Newton-Raphson method for checking convergence.  The calculated         
 reference FORCE CONVERGENCE VALUE = 2.204328257E-06 is less than a      
 threshold.  This threshold is internally calculated.  You can           
 overwrite it by specifying MINREF on the CNVTOL command.  Check         
 results carefully.
