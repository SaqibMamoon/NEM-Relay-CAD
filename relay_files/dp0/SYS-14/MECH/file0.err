 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       9.531   TIME= 18:51:46
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       9.703   TIME= 18:51:47
 Maximum contact stiffness 2.809944716E+20 is too big which can cause an 
 accuracy problem, you may scale the force units in the model.           

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       9.703   TIME= 18:51:47
 Minimum contact depth 2.443885472E-08 is too small which can cause an   
 accuracy problem, you may scale the length units in the model.          

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      11.234   TIME= 18:51:50
 Pivoting has been activated for the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver .  
 The memory required may greatly exceed the predicted amount.  In that   
 event, use the DSPOPTION command to change the memory mode and/or       
 memory size used by the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver.               

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      12.297   TIME= 18:51:52
 A reference force value times the tolerance is used by the              
 Newton-Raphson method for checking convergence.  The calculated         
 reference FORCE CONVERGENCE VALUE = 1.023888102E-08 is less than a      
 threshold.  This threshold defaults to 1.0 or is specified as MINREF    
 on the CNVTOL command.  Check results carefully.                        

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      52.438   TIME= 18:52:38
 A reference force value times the tolerance is used by the              
 Newton-Raphson method for checking convergence.  The calculated         
 reference FORCE CONVERGENCE VALUE = 4.237047765E-06 is less than a      
 threshold.  This threshold defaults to 1.0 or is specified as MINREF    
 on the CNVTOL command.  Check results carefully.                        

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      55.641   TIME= 18:52:42
 A reference force value times the tolerance is used by the              
 Newton-Raphson method for checking convergence.  The calculated         
 reference FORCE CONVERGENCE VALUE = 5.45973793E-06 is less than a       
 threshold.  This threshold defaults to 1.0 or is specified as MINREF    
 on the CNVTOL command.  Check results carefully.                        

 *** ERROR ***                           CP =      68.875   TIME= 18:52:56
 Element 2817 (type = 1, SOLID187) (and maybe other elements) has become 
 highly distorted.  Excessive distortion of elements is usually a        
 symptom indicating the need for corrective action elsewhere.  Try       
 ramping the load up instead of step applying the load (KBC,1).  You     
 may need to improve your mesh to obtain elements with better aspect     
 ratios.  Also consider the behavior of materials, contact pairs,        
 and/or constraint equations.  Please rule out other root causes of      
 this failure before attempting rezoning or nonlinear adaptive           
 solutions.  If this message appears in the first iteration of first     
 substep, be sure to run shape checking of elements.
