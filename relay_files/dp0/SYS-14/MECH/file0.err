 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       9.625   TIME= 11:33:06
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       9.766   TIME= 11:33:07
 Maximum contact stiffness 2.809944716E+20 is too big which can cause an 
 accuracy problem, you may scale the force units in the model.           

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       9.766   TIME= 11:33:07
 Minimum contact depth 2.443885472E-08 is too small which can cause an   
 accuracy problem, you may scale the length units in the model.          

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      11.094   TIME= 11:33:12
 Pivoting has been activated for the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver .  
 The memory required may greatly exceed the predicted amount.  In that   
 event, use the DSPOPTION command to change the memory mode and/or       
 memory size used by the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver.               

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      12.156   TIME= 11:33:14
 A reference force value times the tolerance is used by the              
 Newton-Raphson method for checking convergence.  The calculated         
 reference FORCE CONVERGENCE VALUE = 1.077068352E-08 is less than a      
 threshold.  This threshold defaults to 1.0 or is specified as MINREF    
 on the CNVTOL command.  Check results carefully.                        

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      88.766   TIME= 11:34:49
 A reference force value times the tolerance is used by the              
 Newton-Raphson method for checking convergence.  The calculated         
 reference FORCE CONVERGENCE VALUE = 3.530577772E-07 is less than a      
 threshold.  This threshold defaults to 1.0 or is specified as MINREF    
 on the CNVTOL command.  Check results carefully.                        

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      94.984   TIME= 11:34:57
 A reference force value times the tolerance is used by the              
 Newton-Raphson method for checking convergence.  The calculated         
 reference FORCE CONVERGENCE VALUE = 1.126071568E-06 is less than a      
 threshold.  This threshold defaults to 1.0 or is specified as MINREF    
 on the CNVTOL command.  Check results carefully.
