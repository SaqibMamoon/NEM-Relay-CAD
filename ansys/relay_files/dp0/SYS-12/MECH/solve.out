 The Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver used by the Block Lanczos          
 eigensolver is currently running in the in-core memory mode.  This      
 memory mode uses the most amount of memory in order to avoid using the  
 hard drive as much as possible, which most often results in the         
 fastest solution time.  This mode is recommended if enough physical     
 memory is present to accommodate all of the solver data.

 Reading results into the database (SET command) will update the current 
 displacement and force boundary conditions in the database with the     
 values from the results file for that load set.  Note that any          
 subsequent solutions will use these values unless action is taken to    
 either SAVE the current values or not overwrite them (/EXIT,NOSAVE).
