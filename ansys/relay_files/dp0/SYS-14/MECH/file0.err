 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       0.672   TIME= 08:17:40
 Some of the defined and selected elements did not require FSIN.  Use    
 the SFELIST,ALL,fluid-solid interaction surfaces command to view a      
 list of elements that did have the fluid-solid interaction surfaces     
 surface load stored.                                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       9.625   TIME= 08:17:52
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       9.922   TIME= 08:17:53
 Maximum contact stiffness 2.532948841E+20 is too big which can cause an 
 accuracy problem, you may scale the force units in the model.           

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       9.922   TIME= 08:17:53
 Minimum contact depth 2.575118698E-08 is too small which can cause an   
 accuracy problem, you may scale the length units in the model.          

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      12.953   TIME= 08:18:11
 Pivoting has been activated for the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver .  
 The memory required may greatly exceed the predicted amount.  In that   
 event, use the DSPOPTION command to change the memory mode and/or       
 memory size used by the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver.               

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      14.281   TIME= 08:18:14
 A reference force value times the tolerance is used by the              
 Newton-Raphson method for checking convergence.  The calculated         
 reference FORCE CONVERGENCE VALUE = 1.03721603E-08 is less than a       
 threshold.  This threshold defaults to 1.0 or is specified as MINREF    
 on the CNVTOL command.  Check results carefully.
