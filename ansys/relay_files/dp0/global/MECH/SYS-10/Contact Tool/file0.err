 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.359   TIME= 20:42:57
 Maximum friction coefficient 0.5 is defined in the model.  Switch to    
 the unsymmetric solver (NROP,UNSYM) instead if convergence difficulty   
 is encountered.                                                         

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.359   TIME= 20:42:57
 Maximum contact stiffness 1.501920395E+20 is too big which can cause an 
 accuracy problem, you may scale the force units in the model.           

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.359   TIME= 20:42:57
 Minimum contact depth 2.642615979E-08 is too small which can cause an   
 accuracy problem, you may scale the length units in the model.
