 Maximum contact stiffness 1.306863824E+20 is too big which can cause an 
 accuracy problem, you may scale the force units in the model.           

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =      74.828   TIME= 08:02:10
 Minimum contact depth 2.642615979E-08 is too small which can cause an   
 accuracy problem, you may scale the length units in the model.

 Pivoting has been activated for the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver .  
 The memory required may greatly exceed the predicted amount.  In that   
 event, use the DSPOPTION command to change the memory mode and/or       
 memory size used by the Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver.
