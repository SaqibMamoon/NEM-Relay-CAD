 The Distributed Sparse Matrix Solver is currently running in the        
 in-core memory mode.  This memory mode uses the most amount of memory   
 in order to avoid using the hard drive as much as possible, which most  
 often results in the fastest solution time.  This mode is recommended   
 if enough physical memory is present to accommodate all of the solver

 A reference force value times the tolerance is used by the              
 Newton-Raphson method for checking convergence.  The calculated         
 reference FORCE CONVERGENCE VALUE = 2.749690097E-09 is less than a      
 threshold.  This threshold is internally calculated.  You can           
 overwrite it by specifying MINREF on the CNVTOL command.  Check         
 results carefully.
