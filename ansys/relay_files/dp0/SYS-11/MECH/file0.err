 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.000   TIME= 07:22:25
 Element shape checking is currently inactive.  Issue SHPP,ON or         
 SHPP,WARN to reactivate, if desired.                                    

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.375   TIME= 07:22:26
 Maximum contact stiffness 4.566666485E+19 is too big which can cause an 
 accuracy problem, you may scale the force units in the model.           

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       1.375   TIME= 07:22:26
 Minimum contact depth 2.575118698E-08 is too small which can cause an   
 accuracy problem, you may scale the length units in the model.          

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       4.062   TIME= 07:22:32
 A reference force value times the tolerance is used by the              
 Newton-Raphson method for checking convergence.  The calculated         
 reference FORCE CONVERGENCE VALUE = 2.749690097E-09 is less than a      
 threshold.  This threshold is internally calculated.  You can           
 overwrite it by specifying MINREF on the CNVTOL command.  Check         
 results carefully.
